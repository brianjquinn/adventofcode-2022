# adventofcode-2022

A repository for solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) implemented in Go.

For now, if you want to run this repository:

1. have the go version from `go.mod` installed
2. run `go run .` at the root of the repository

Lastly, be kind... prior to this, I have never written a line of Go.
